# erebus

A free and open source Hyperion deobfuscator.

## Usage

Currently erebus cannot be used to unpack, what I call, "stage 1" or "wrapper" files. 
This functionality will be added soon.

It is able to deobfuscate "stage 2" or "real-code" files, which are zlib compressed in wrapper file.
(Might not work)
